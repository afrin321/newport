            <p className='text-gray-700'>Hi, my name is Afrin Haque. A <span className='text-orange-800'>Software Engineer</span> by profession with <span className='poppins-medium'>2+ Years</span> of <span>industry experience.</span></p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>I started my career as a <span className='poppins-medium'>front-end</span> engineer after completing a bachelors degree in Computer Science.</p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>I always wanted to build <i className='poppins-light-italic'>full-fledged & quality-full</i> systems. As I worked alongside backend teams, I encountered terms like <i>'Scalable'</i> and <i>'Web Services'</i>. </p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>I soon became intrigued by how big companies such as Netflix and Meta managed load and maintained consistency and availability in their applications, across continents.</p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-2xl w-[90%]'>After delving into the topics, I realized that <span className='poppins-medium'>real</span> applications are more than just a bunch of technical requirements.</p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>Compliance and Risk management plays a massive role in building <i>resilient</i> systems. Soon, I pursued a year long diploma in Cyber and Cloud Security. By constant learning, I intend to always integrate standard practices in development. </p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>Now, thats enough of <span className='poppins-medium'>Tech Talk</span>! <span className='hidden'>(I'm kinda obsessed...)</span></p>
            <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl w-[90%]'>I usually prefer tea over coffee and like pineapple pizza. When I'm not working, I unwind by exploring creative pursuits in books, art and nature. </p>
